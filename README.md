# Lissajous-Curves

Lissajous curves are graphical representations of a point's movement, determined by two perpendicular simple harmonic motions. These curves are generated by combining two sinusoids. The parametric equations are:

- **x(t) =  A sin(at + φ)**
- **y(t) = B sin(bt)**

The meaning of the parameters is as follows:

- **A** and **B** are the amplitudes along the X and Y axes, respectively.
- **a** and **b** are the angular frecuencies of the sinusoids.
- **φ** is the phase difference of the two waves.
- **t** is the time parameter.

Different combinations of parameters result in different figures. Here is an example:
